// What is a Data Struture ?
// A way to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

// Example:
// Unorganized Data: [7, 2, 4, 9, 0, 6, 3, 1, 5, 8] 😣
// Organized Data (Sorted): [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 😍


// What is sn Algorithm?
// A set of well-defined instructions or steps to solve a problem or perform a task (like arranging data).

// Example:
// The process used to sort the unorganized array into an ordered one is an Algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
